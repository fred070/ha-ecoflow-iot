# EcoFlow IoT for Home Assistant

A clean, production-ready custom integration for EcoFlow devices built on the
**official EcoFlow Developer API** (the `accessKey`/`secretKey` IoT Open Platform).
It uses **MQTT for live data and control**, and automatically **falls back to the
HTTP REST API** when MQTT is unavailable.

It aims for **feature parity with the official EcoFlow developer documentation**
(<https://developer-eu.ecoflow.com/us/document/introduction>): every supported
device's documented quota fields and set-commands are mapped to Home Assistant
entities.

Device definitions are organised into category packages that mirror the EcoFlow
developer-docs catalog, and resolution is automatic from each device's serial
number. Adding another device later is a single new module.

## Supported devices

Resolved automatically by serial-number prefix (with quota-based fallback). ~1,290
entities are mapped across the fleet from the official quota schemas. Each link below
lists every sensor / binary sensor / switch / number / select for that device
(generated from the code — see [`docs/devices/`](docs/devices/README.md)).

The full entity reference index lives in [`docs/devices/README.md`](docs/devices/README.md);
regenerate it after changing entities with `python3 scripts/gen_device_docs.py`.

Devices are matched by **serial-number prefix**. If Home Assistant shows an
**"Unsupported EcoFlow device (`XXXX`)" repair**, your device's prefix isn't mapped
yet — check [`KNOWN_PREFIXES.md`](KNOWN_PREFIXES.md), and if it's missing please
[open an issue](https://github.com/MichelFR/ha-ecoflow-iot/issues) with the prefix (not your
full serial) so it can be added.

Some devices **cannot** be supported because EcoFlow's open API does not serve them:
the legacy **Delta Mini** and **River 2** (API error 1006), and the **EcoFlow x Shelly**
plug / meter (use the native Shelly integration instead). They are skipped silently;
the full list is in [`KNOWN_PREFIXES.md`](KNOWN_PREFIXES.md#recognised-but-not-supported-silenced--no-repair-raised).

## Features

- **MQTT-first, HTTP fallback** — real-time push updates over TLS MQTT; HTTP polling
  kicks in only when MQTT is disconnected or stale, keeping cloud API usage minimal.
- **Control over MQTT with HTTP fallback** — set commands are published over MQTT and
  confirmed via `set_reply`; if MQTT is down or unacknowledged, the command is retried
  over HTTP `PUT`.
- **MQTT connection status sensor** — an always-available diagnostic sensor per device
  showing `connected` / `connecting` / `disconnected`, plus the active data source and
  last MQTT update time.
- **Full entity coverage** — sensors (battery, solar per-MPPT, grid/AC, inverter, power
  flow, energy totals), binary sensors, switches, numbers and a mode select.
- **Energy Dashboard ready** — devices expose cumulative `Wh` energy sensors (solar
  production, grid import/export, battery charge/discharge, per-device consumption),
  derived from live power where the API reports only watts, so they plug straight into
  Home Assistant's **Energy** dashboard. See the
  [Energy Dashboard setup guide](docs/energy_dashboard.md) for the per-device mapping and
  the grid/battery sign conventions.
- **Bundled Lovelace card** — an **EcoFlow Energy** card for Stream devices, with the
  device image, an animated battery bar, live Solar and Grid power, today's solar
  production (with an optional forecast comparison) and a tap-to-expand per-panel
  breakdown. Entities are auto-detected; it ships with the integration and registers
  itself, so no manual resource setup is needed. See [EcoFlow Energy card](#ecoflow-energy-card).
- Config flow with region selection, reauth, options (poll interval, MQTT staleness,
  MQTT enable/disable), and redacted diagnostics.

## Requirements

1. An EcoFlow developer account at <https://developer.ecoflow.com> (EU:
   <https://developer-eu.ecoflow.com>). Under **Security**, create an **AccessKey** and
   **SecretKey** (approval can take a few days).
2. Your device must be bound to the same EcoFlow account.

## Installation

### Option A — HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=MichelFR&repository=ha-ecoflow-iot&category=integration)

1. Click the button above to add this repository to HACS — or add it manually:
   **HACS → ⋮ (top-right) → Custom repositories**, URL
   `https://github.com/MichelFR/ha-ecoflow-iot`, category **Integration**.
2. Search for **EcoFlow IoT** in HACS and click **Download**.
3. **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Option B — Manual

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/MichelFR/ha-ecoflow-iot/releases)
   (or clone this repo).
2. Copy the `custom_components/ecoflow_iot` folder into your Home Assistant
   `config/custom_components/` directory (so you have
   `config/custom_components/ecoflow_iot/`).
3. **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Configure

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ecoflow_iot)

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**, search for
   **EcoFlow IoT** (or use the button above).
2. Choose your **Region** (Europe = `api-e.ecoflow.com`, Global/US =
   `api.ecoflow.com`, Asia = `api-a.ecoflow.com`) and paste your **Access Key** and **Secret Key**.
3. That's it — every device bound to your account is discovered automatically and
   its sensors/controls are created. Live values stream over MQTT within seconds.

### Using it

- **Entities:** each device gets sensors (battery, solar, grid, power flow, energy
  totals…), controls (switches/numbers/selects for the documented settings) and an
  always-available **Connection** diagnostic sensor. See
  [Supported devices](#supported-devices) for the full per-device list.
- **Energy dashboard:** the cumulative `Wh`/`kWh` energy sensors carry the right
  `device_class`/`state_class`, so they can be added to Home Assistant's **Energy**
  dashboard. For the Stream, see the [Energy Dashboard setup guide](docs/energy_dashboard.md)
  (which sensor goes in each field, plus the grid/battery sign conventions).
- **Options** (gear icon on the integration): HTTP poll interval, MQTT staleness
  threshold, and an MQTT on/off toggle. HTTP-only values (marked 🌐 in the per-device
  docs) are refreshed over HTTP on the poll interval even while MQTT is connected, but
  only for devices that have such entities.
- **Re-authentication:** if you rotate your API keys, Home Assistant prompts you to
  re-enter them — no need to delete the integration.

### EcoFlow Energy card

The integration bundles a custom Lovelace card, **EcoFlow Energy**, tailored to Stream
devices (Ultra / Ultra X / AC / AC Pro / Pro). It serves and registers itself, so in the
common case you just add it from the dashboard's card picker.

<p align="center">
  <picture><source srcset="docs/images/energy-card.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="docs/images/energy-card.gif" alt="EcoFlow Energy card" width="460"></picture>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <picture><source srcset="docs/images/energy-card-solar-today.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="docs/images/energy-card-solar-today.png" alt="Solar today graph" width="520"></picture>
</p>

- **Add it:** edit a dashboard → **+ Add Card** → search for **EcoFlow Energy**. With a
  single Stream it auto-detects everything; with more than one, pick the device in the
  card's visual editor.
- **Shows:** the device photo inside a **circular battery gauge** — a state-of-charge ring
  that changes colour and animates (a travelling spark) while charging/discharging, with the
  level as a badge and the charge/discharge speed as a chip —
  **Solar power**, **Grid power** (import/export), the **AC sockets** (shown beside the
  gauge, with live draw + an on/off toggle that asks for confirmation before
  switching a socket off), and **today's solar production** with an optional forecast
  comparison. Tap
  **Solar power** for a per-panel (per-MPPT) breakdown; tap **Solar today** for an hourly
  production graph with the forecast curve overlaid (like the Energy dashboard's Solar
  production card).
- **Solar forecast:** uses the **same forecast configured in Home Assistant's Energy
  dashboard** (Settings → Dashboards → Energy → Solar panels). The card's editor lists
  those forecast providers (with their integration brand icons, like HA does) so you can
  choose which to include; the dashed forecast curve and the "X / Y kWh" comparison are
  drawn from them. Turning off **Compare today's production with the forecast** disables
  the whole forecast section, including the provider options. If no Energy-dashboard
  forecast is set up, the card simply omits the comparison.
- **Follow a date selection:** set an **Energy collection key** (Advanced page in the
  editor) matching a `hui-energy-period-selector` (Energy date selection) card's
  `collection_key`, and the card shows the selected day's production and graph instead of
  today's — so a period selector on the same view drives the card's date.
- **Device image:** auto-selected from the device model, or pick one from a gallery of
  bundled EcoFlow product images (the whole supported fleet) in the editor. When the image
  is turned off, the gauge shows a battery icon instead.
- **Editor:** an ABRP-style visual editor — Appearance toggles + the device-image picker,
  an Entities page for overriding any auto-detected entity (Auto / Entity / Custom-template),
  a **Solar panels** page to rename, re-map or hide each panel, and a **Solar forecast** page
  to pick which forecast providers to use.
- **Today's total** is read from the recorder's statistics for the cumulative Solar
  energy sensor (the same source as the Energy Dashboard), so the **recorder** must be
  enabled (it is by default).
- The card is auto-registered as a dashboard resource when Lovelace runs in **storage
  mode** (the default UI mode). In **YAML mode**, add the resource manually:
  `/ecoflow_iot/ecoflow-energy-card.js` as a **JavaScript Module**.

### EcoFlow House card

A second bundled card, **EcoFlow House**, draws the whole-home energy-flow illustration:
a rendered house with the battery/inverter box in front, the live **Grid**, **Solar** and
**Home** figures across the top, the **battery** state below, and **animated flow lines**
between them — solar when the panels produce, grid in/out by direction, and battery
charge/discharge. It's the same scene the EcoFlow app shows, built from the app's own
artwork and flow animations.

- **Add it:** **+ Add Card** → search for **EcoFlow House**. Entities auto-detect from the
  integration (shared with the Energy card); with more than one Stream, pick the device in
  the editor.
- **Pick the house:** the editor offers **9 house styles** and a **Day / Night / Automatic**
  picture (Automatic follows the sun, falling back to the UI theme).
- **Pick the battery:** choose the device render shown in front of the house from a gallery
  (EcoFlow Stream, Stream Ultra and more). The animated SoC fill and charge/discharge glow
  are shown for the Stream system battery, which they're aligned to; other renders are shown
  statically.
- **Configure:** toggle each flow/figure on or off and override any of the driving sensors.
  The solar flow matches the chosen house.
- Registers itself as a dashboard resource the same way as the Energy card; in **YAML mode**
  it's the same module: `/ecoflow_iot/ecoflow-energy-card.js`.

### EcoFlow Space card

A third bundled card, **EcoFlow Space**, is a **full-screen, fully configurable** whole-home
dashboard modelled on the EcoFlow app's "space" view: the house illustration with a left
icon **sidebar**, a top bar (**clock** + **weather**), **floating overlays** over the scene,
and a row of **stat tiles** along the bottom.

<p align="center">
  <picture><source srcset="docs/images/space-card.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="docs/images/space-card.png" alt="EcoFlow Space card" width="680"></picture>
</p>

- **Add it:** **+ Add Card** → search for **EcoFlow Space**. Out of the box it auto-discovers
  the integration and your Home Assistant **Energy dashboard**, so it looks like the app with
  no manual wiring.
- **Overlays & tiles:** each floating overlay and bottom tile can use a **preset** (Solar /
  Grid / Battery; or today's Solar / Consumption / Energy-independence from the Energy
  dashboard), an explicit **entity**, or a live **Jinja template** — with dynamic value
  colours, per-overlay size, and Home Assistant's native icon/colour pickers in the editor.
- **Sidebar tabs:** the first tab is the scene above; each additional tab **embeds an
  existing Lovelace view by its path**, rendered inline. Icons, labels and alignment are
  configurable.
- **Top bar:** an optional **clock** (with date) and a **weather** widget, each with its own
  size; the tile row scales too.
- **Solar dialog:** tapping the Solar overlay or tile opens the same hourly-production +
  forecast graph and **per-array breakdown** as the Energy card.
- Drag overlays to position them in the visual editor; reuses the House card's artwork and
  flow animations, and fills the screen when cast to a display (e.g. a Nest Hub). Same
  bundled module / resource as the other cards.

## How data flows

```
EcoFlow Cloud ──MQTT (TLS 8883)──▶ live quota push ──▶ entities (instant)
        │                                  ▲
        └──HTTP REST (signed) ─ fallback ──┘  (only when MQTT down/stale)
```

- Reads: MQTT updates merge into a per-device quota snapshot and push to HA. The polling
  tick performs an HTTP `quota/all` refresh only when MQTT is disconnected or no message
  has arrived within the staleness window.
- Writes: published to `/open/{account}/{sn}/set`, correlated to the device's
  `set_reply`; on timeout/disconnect, the same payload is sent via HTTP `PUT`.

## Connection resilience (MQTT down → HTTP → auto-recover)

The integration degrades gracefully and recovers on its own — you don't need to
reload it after a network blip:

1. **MQTT keeps reconnecting in the background.** The MQTT client runs paho's own
   network loop, which automatically retries the initial connection and reconnects
   after any unexpected drop, with built-in backoff (≈1s, doubling up to ~120s). The
   loop is only stopped when you remove/reload the integration.
2. **HTTP covers the gap.** While MQTT is not connected (or no MQTT message has
   arrived within the staleness window), the periodic poll falls back to the HTTP
   REST API, so entities keep updating — just at the poll interval instead of in
   real time. The **Connection** sensor shows `connecting` and `data_source: http`.
3. **Auto-recovery.** When MQTT reconnects, it **re-subscribes** to all topics and
   the Connection sensor returns to `connected`. As soon as live messages resume,
   HTTP polling automatically stops again (`data_source: mqtt`).
4. **Rotated credentials.** If the broker rejects the stored credentials (they are
   rotated by EcoFlow during maintenance), the client re-fetches a fresh certificate
   from the API and reconnects, rather than looping on stale credentials.

In short: a temporary MQTT outage causes a short switch to slower HTTP polling and an
automatic return to real-time MQTT once connectivity is restored.

## FAQ / troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>The integration sets up fine but shows no devices or entities</strong></summary>

Almost always the EcoFlow **open API refuses to serve the device** with
`EcoFlow API error 1006: current device is not allowed to get device info`.
The device is listed on your account, but EcoFlow's servers deny access to its
data. The integration cannot work around this: the decision is made on
EcoFlow's side, before any data reaches Home Assistant.

Since v0.44.9 such a device shows up as a Repair (Settings → Repairs, "EcoFlow
device not served by the open API") and as a warning in the log. In diagnostics
it appears under `unmapped_devices` with an empty quota.

Two reasons we have seen so far:

- **The device is not on the developer platform at all.** Delta Mini (`DBAB…`)
  and River 2 (`R60…`) are not listed in EcoFlow's developer documentation and
  always answer 1006 ([#13](https://github.com/MichelFR/ha-ecoflow-iot/issues/13)).
  They are skipped silently; the app is the only way to reach them.
- **Your developer account is not enabled for the product line.** Home-energy
  systems such as PowerOcean are documented, but EcoFlow may still have to
  grant API access per account
  ([#16](https://github.com/MichelFR/ha-ecoflow-iot/issues/16)).

What to check:

1. The device is bound to the **same EcoFlow account** whose e-mail you used on
   [developer.ecoflow.com](https://developer.ecoflow.com). Developer keys only
   see devices of that account.
2. The device is online and visible in the EcoFlow app.
3. Settings → Devices & services → EcoFlow IoT → ⋮ → **Reload** after fixing
   anything above (devices are only probed once, at startup).
4. Still 1006? Ask EcoFlow developer support to enable API access for that
   product on your account. If they confirm the device is served but the
   integration still shows nothing, open an issue with the diagnostics
   attached (Settings → Devices & services → EcoFlow IoT → ⋮ → *Download
   diagnostics*; serial numbers are redacted).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The integration fails to set up with "returned no devices for these keys"</strong></summary>

The device list for your keys is empty. The keys belong to a developer account
with no bound devices; see check 1 above.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The database grows fast / the recorder writes a lot</strong></summary>

Stream-family devices push a full data snapshot over MQTT every ~2 s, and most
live readings really do change between pushes (power jitters by a few watts
while the unit regulates to zero grid). Home Assistant's recorder stores a row
for every state change, so a handful of live sensors can dominate the `states`
table: on a Stream Ultra with a Smart Meter, 18 power sensors produced roughly
900 000 of the 2.3 M rows in a 10-day window
([#17](https://github.com/MichelFR/ha-ecoflow-iot/issues/17)).

What the integration already does about it:

- Energy totals (Wh) are written at most every 10 s or on a ≥ 1 Wh step
  (v0.44.8). Their precision is unchanged.
- A push from one device only refreshes that device's entities (v0.44.8).
- No fast-changing attributes: the last-update timestamp is a disabled-by-default
  diagnostic sensor, and the battery charging icon can no longer produce
  attribute-only state rows (v0.44.11).

What it cannot do: Home Assistant offers integrations no way to keep an entity
out of the recorder. Which history to keep is your decision, made in the
recorder configuration. If you want the live readings in the UI and in
automations but not on disk, exclude them:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml — adjust the globs to your entity_ids
recorder:
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      - sensor.ecoflow_stream_*_power
      - sensor.ecoflow_stream_load_from_*
```

Excluded entities keep updating in real time; only their history graph and
long-term statistics disappear. Restart Home Assistant after changing it.

Which entities make sense to exclude:

- **Yes — instantaneous power (W):** battery, solar, per-string, grid, system
  grid, load and load-from-* power, AC socket power, total AC power, available
  charge power. They are what you watch live, not what you chart for months.
- **Yes — live electrical readings:** string voltage/current, grid
  voltage/frequency and, with a Smart Meter, per-phase voltage/current/power
  factor. Two-decimal readings that change on every push.
- **No — energy totals (Wh / kWh):** solar energy, grid import/export, battery
  charge/discharge, socket energy, total charged/discharged, local meter
  import/export. The Energy Dashboard is built from their statistics, and they
  are already throttled.
- **No — slow values with useful history:** battery level, health, temperatures,
  cycles, time to full/empty, connection and mode entities. They change rarely
  and cost almost nothing.

Purging what is already there: `recorder.purge_entities` with your entity_ids
and `keep_days: 0`, then `recorder.purge` with `repack: true` to shrink the file.
Statistics are never touched by either.

</details>

## Manual test checklist

1. Add the integration; confirm a device and its entities are created.
2. The **Connection** sensor shows `connected` and `data_source: mqtt`.
3. Battery/solar/grid values update live (within seconds) without polling.
4. Temporarily block outbound MQTT (port 8883): the Connection sensor flips to
   `disconnected`, `data_source` becomes `http`, and values keep updating on the poll
   interval.
5. Toggle an AC socket switch / change the charge-limit number: the device reacts and
   the new state survives a refresh.
6. Download diagnostics (device page → ⋮ → *Download diagnostics*) and verify keys are
   redacted.

## Entities per device

Every device exposes an always-available **Connection** diagnostic sensor
(`connected` / `connecting` / `disconnected`, plus data source and last-update).

The complete per-device entity tables (sensors, binary sensors, switches, numbers,
selects — with device class, unit, underlying quota key and diagnostic/disabled
flags) are generated from the device definitions and live under
[`docs/devices/`](docs/devices/README.md). See the per-device links in
[Supported devices](#supported-devices) above. Regenerate them with:

```bash
python3 scripts/gen_device_docs.py
```

**Adding a device** = drop one `devices/<category>/<model>.py` with an `EcoFlowDevice`
subclass (declaring its `model`, `sn_prefixes`, `matches()`, per-platform
`entity_descriptions()`, and `command_fn`s) and register it in `devices/__init__.py`.
No platform code changes. Each device's command style is handled by its
`command_fn`/`build_command`: the Stream/Delta-3 envelope (`cmdId/cmdFunc`), the legacy
`moduleType`/`operateType` body, the `cmdSet`/`id` body, or `cmdCode` — all built via
`devices/commands.py`.

`resolve_device()` is **SN-prefix-authoritative**: a serial's prefix selects the model;
quota fields only disambiguate models that share a prefix (e.g. Delta 3 Max vs Max Plus)
or identify devices with an unknown serial.

Not affiliated with or endorsed by EcoFlow. Device definitions are generated from the
official EcoFlow developer documentation (quota schemas + set-commands); some
